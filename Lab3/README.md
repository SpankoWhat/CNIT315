Primary Goal:

Develop linked lists and then use the linked lists to build data structures. This lab is broken into 2 parts. The first part is construction of the single linked list with all of its structure and functions.
The second part is the use of the linked list to construct stacks and queues, and trees. The structures will then be used to store and search for data. The second part of the lab will be given next, as Lab 4.
To build the data structure, you will have an interactive menu, with a menu choice that represents each of the functions below. In total, beyond the main, there are 10 functions, so 10 choices on the menu.
1. Create a List with no nodes and just a start pointer 
2. Create a list with a single node 
3. Insert a node at the front of the list
4. insert a node in the middle of the of the list
5. ...
6. Exit the program

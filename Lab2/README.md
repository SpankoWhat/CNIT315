Primary Goal
Test and complete an ANSIC program which uses functions, pointers and recursion. You will use multiple recursion to solve a maze puzzle which is a common use for everyday tasks and the basis of many AI problems.

Maze
A robot is asked to navigate a maze. It is placed at a certain position (the starting position) in the maze and is asked to try to reach another position (the goal position). Positions in the maze will either be open or blocked with an obstacle. Positions are identified by (x,y) coordinates. The start, goal and obstructions can be in any spaces of the maze. Your robot should be able to navigate any and all valid paths through the maze to find the goal.

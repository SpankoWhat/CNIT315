Goals
The primary goal of this first project is to write, test and complete a basic C program that takes inputs, completes some basic calculations and provides some output. It will emphasize the use of basic ANSI C language syntax, experience with types and variables and explore the use of user interaction. The secondary goal of this second project is input verification and checking.

Specifications
In this exercise, you will ask a user for input relative to calculating the size, water capacity and cost required to fill a pool and hot tub. The pool and hot tub are not connected, but will be specified at the same time. You will write code so the user can enter the dimensions and then calculate the capacity of the pool and hot tub.
